vim-jsx
=======

Syntax highlighting and indenting for JSX.  JSX is a JavaScript syntax
transformer which translates inline XML document fragments into JavaScript
objects.  It was developed by Facebook alongside [React][1].

This bundle requires pangloss's [vim-javascript][2] syntax highlighting.

Vim support for inline XML in JS is remarkably similar to the same for PHP,
which you can find [here][3].

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you're experiencing weird highlighting or indenting throughout your JSX
code, please file a GitHub issue which includes the following:

- A brief affirmation that you've read the README and installed the appropriate
  dependencies.

- A minimal ~/.vimrc which repros the issue you're having, as well as a
  screenshot or gif of the issue (a paste is insufficient, since it doesn't
  show me the specific highlighting or indenting problem).  To obtain a minimal
  ~/.vimrc, simply bisect your ~/.vimrc by adding `finish` at various points in
  the file.  (You can likewise bisect your included plugins by selectively
  including only half of them, then a quarter, etc.).

Most of the issues filed result from failures to install vim-javascript or
conflicts with existing JS syntax or indent files---so failing to indicate that
you've ruled those issues out may result in your issue being closed with no
comment.

(Please feel free to disregard all this for feature requests and more
corner-case bugs.)

Usage
-----

By default, JSX syntax highlighting and indenting will be enabled only for
files with the `.jsx` extension.  If you would like JSX in `.js` files, add

```viml
let g:jsx_ext_required = 0
```

to your .vimrc or somewhere in your include path.  If you wish to restrict JSX
to files with the pre-v0.12 `@jsx React.DOM` pragma, add

```viml
let g:jsx_pragma_required = 1
```

to your .vimrc or somewhere in your include path.

Please note that this package does not support syntax folding, and has not been
tested with either JavaScript or XML folding enabled.

Installation
------------

### Pathogen

The recommended installation method is via [Pathogen][4].  Then simply execute

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/mxw/vim-jsx.git

(You can install [vim-javascript][2] in an analogous manner.)

### Vundle

You can also add vim-jsx using [Vundle][5]---just add the following line to
your .vimrc:

    Bundle 'mxw/vim-jsx'

### Manual Installation

If you have no `~/.vim/after` directory, you can download the tarball or zip
and copy the contents to `~/.vim`.

If you have existing `~/.vim/after` files, copy the syntax and indent files
directly into their respective destinations.  If you have existing after syntax
or indent files for Javascript, you'll probably want to do something like

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/after/syntax/javascript
    cp path/to/vim-jsx/after/syntax/jsx.vim ~/.vim/after/syntax/javascript/jsx.vim
    mkdir -p ~/.vim/after/indent/javascript
    cp path/to/vim-jsx/after/indent/jsx.vim ~/.vim/after/indent/javascript/jsx.vim
