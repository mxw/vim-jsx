vim-jsx
=======

Syntax highlighting and indenting for JSX.  JSX is a JavaScript syntax
transformer which translates inline XML document fragments into JavaScript
objects.  It was developed by Facebook alongside [React][1].

This bundle requires pangloss's [vim-javascript][2] or jiangmiao's [simple-javascript-indenter][5] plugin.

Vim support for inline XML in JS is remarkably similar to the same for PHP,
which you can find [here][3].

Usage
-----

By default, JSX syntax highlighting and indenting will be enabled only for
files with the `.jsx` extension.  If you would like JSX in `.js` files, add

```viml
let g:jsx_ext_required = 0
```

to your .vimrc or somewhere in your include path.  If you wish to restrict JSX
to files with the pre-v0.12 `@jsx React.DOM` pragma, add

```viml
let g:jsx_pragma_required = 1
```

to your .vimrc or somewhere in your include path.

Please note that this package does not support syntax folding, and has not been
tested with either JavaScript or XML folding enabled.

Installation
------------

### Pathogen

The recommended installation method is via [Pathogen][4].  Then simply execute

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/mxw/vim-jsx.git

### Manual Installation

If you have no `~/.vim/after` directory, you can download the tarball or zip
and copy the contents to `~/.vim`.

If you have existing `~/.vim/after` files, copy the syntax and indent files
directly into their respective destinations.  If you have existing after syntax
or indent files for Javascript, you'll probably want to do something like

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/after/syntax/javascript
    cp path/to/vim-jsx/after/syntax/javascript.vim ~/.vim/after/syntax/javascript/javascript.vim
    mkdir -p ~/.vim/after/indent/javascript
    cp path/to/vim-jsx/after/indent/javascript.vim ~/.vim/after/indent/javascript/javascript.vim
